### Title: 
***Mapping MeSH (ICD codes) to molecular mechanism through protein-protein co-occurance graph***

### Detail:

One of the central idea in personalized medicine is to understanding the disease in terms of molecular mechanism in personal interactome. The personal interactome could be built through personal omics and past history of medical records (e.g., EHR, EMR). In this project, our attempt will be to create a mapping of Medical Subjet Heading (MeSH) to relevant protein-protein co-occurance graph. Since MeSH terms are organized in hierarchical tree structure, we are only considering the leaf nodes of the cardiovascular tree.  With protein-protein co-occurance graph, one can extend it to relevant genes, metabolites and molecular pathways.
